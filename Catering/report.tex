\section{Problem C: Catering}

\subsection{Problem Specification}


Paul owns a catering company and business is booming. The company has $k$
catering teams, each in charge of one set of catering equipment. Every
week, the company accepts $n$ catering requests for various events.
For every request, they send a catering team with their equipment to the
event location. The team delivers the food, sets up the equipment, and instructs
the host on how to use the equipment and serve the food. After the event, the
host is responsible for returning the equipment back to Paulâ€™s company.

Unfortunately, in some weeks the number of catering teams is less than the number
of requests, so some teams may have to be used for more than one event. In these
cases, the company cannot wait for the host to return the equipment and must keep
the team on-site to move the equipment to another location. The company has an
accurate estimate of the cost to move a set of equipment from any location to any
other location. Given these costs, Paul wants to prepare an Advance Catering Map
to service the requests while minimizing the total moving cost of equipment
(including the cost of the first move), even if that means not using all the
available teams. Paul needs your help to write a program to accomplish this task.
The requests are sorted in ascending order of their event times and they are
chosen in such a way that for any $i < j$, there is enough time to
transport the equipment used in the $i$-th request to the location of the
$j$-th request.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}

\subsection{Problem Size}

We are given an unknown amount of test cases that we have to solve in under
three seconds. However, our given variables do have bounds. The number
of teams, $k$, and the number of requests, $n$, are both bounded by
0 and 100, inclusive. The $i$th request (counting from 1) has $n - i + 1$
connections to the requests after it.
